# SpaceInvaders

This game still contains some bugs and lacks good design.
Future versions will adress those bugs, improve design.
Game is implemented in python using pyglet.
User can shoot by pressing space button, and needs
to eliminate all enemy spaceships. If the user was hit
by bullet, it is Game Over.
